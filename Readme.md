# Node.js Runner

This Node.js runner is a docker container designed to run Node.js within the docker sandbox.

The initial purpose of the Node.js runner is to provide a safe environment for a Node.js repl built into a slide deck to run without the potential that the host system could be compromised. I would love to hear about other purposes this has been used for though.
